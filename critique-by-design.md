# Assignment 3 and 4
This assignment required selecting a graph in written work to interpret, critique, analyze, and redesign. The analysis below indicates each individual part of this process as it was completed. 

# Selection of Graph
For this weeks graph, I chose a graph found with an analysis of housing markets completed by the Urban Institute. The graph can be found below. 

https://apps.urban.org/features/state-economic-monitor/?start=1-2000&end=4-2019&states=CA-TX-US&indicator=house_price_index&unit=change

The graph was chosen based upon my interest in housing policy. Housing policy is one of my main areas of reseaarch focus, thus selecting a graph relating to a housing topic, allows me to create the best critique and redesigin possible. Further the context of the graph is based upon shifting housing markets throughout California and Texas. The fact the graph shows shiting changes within the data, meaans its impact is not static. This indicates to me that the data behind the graph is compelling and can offer additional stories about regional housing shifts. The non static information also provides additional opportunity to examine markets beyond California and Texas.  The flexibility to add additional means of regional analysis, provides ample opportunity for successful graph redesign, making the graph a compelling candidate for narrative creation. Finally, the topic of housing prices is one that is relevant for ongoing policy makers as affordable housing development becomes more expansive throughout the United States.

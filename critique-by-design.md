# Assignment 3 and 4
This assignment required selecting a graph in written work to interpret, critique, analyze, and redesign. The analysis below indicates each individual part of this process as it was completed. 

# Selection of Graph
For this weeks graph, I chose a graph found with an analysis of housing markets completed by the Urban Institute. The graph can be found below.

The graph was chosen based upon my interest in housing policy. Housing policy is one of my main areas of reseaarch focus, thus selecting a graph relating to a housing topic, allows me to create the best critique and redesigin possible. Further the context of the graph is based upon shifting housing markets throughout California and Texas. The fact the graph shows shiting changes within the data, meaans its impact is not static. This indicates to me that the data behind the graph is compelling and can offer additional stories about regional housing shifts. The non static information also provides additional opportunity to examine markets beyond California and Texas.  The flexibility to add additional means of regional analysis, provides ample opportunity for successful graph redesign, making the graph a compelling candidate for narrative creation. Finally, the topic of housing prices is one that is relevant for ongoing policy makers as affordable housing development becomes more expansive throughout the United States.  


# Anaylsis of Graph Effectiveness

Upon first glance, the graph is relatively intuitive to understand. The simplicity in the design allows a reader to understand the comparisons being made amongst the individual markets assessed. The non static nature of the lines, allows for an intuition to understand how housing prices increased and decreased along the studied perid of time. This allows for policy makers to make compelling insights around what events within the 2000's such as elections, recessions, wars etc.. could have had upon housing markets. The trend lines could provide insight into the types of policies whihc have been effective in creation naturally affordable housing prices. 
It is clear from the graph, that is usefullness is limited by its current scope. The graph could work in conjunction with another graph that provides additional context to regions within the United States. Further a lack of numbers on the graph also make the graph less useful in  terms of overall averages of housing prices. The data set itself did not have housing prices readily available, and without them, the graph misses out on additional clarification of what a drop and or increased percentage needs per individual percentage changes in housing prices. The non use of a title on the y axis to better explain they are percentages, also leads to a lack of transparency and usefullness. If a reader could not associate the y axis with percentages, the the axis and comparing point of the graph becomes unclear.
  The y axis also has a 0 split in the middle of it, which does not assist with the peceptinility and completeness of the graph. Having a number line in the middle of the graph without dropping the  x axis further down, confused readers with what negative numbers versus positive numbers indicate. This design error decreases the effect of the information, and can leave readers less engaged to the graphs impact. 
    The intersecting of lines,also decreases the readibility and usefullness of the graph.  As the graph gets further down the scale of time, it becomes more crowded. This leads a loss of engagement as a result of undecipherable results. A spreading out of points along the graph would make the storyclear and allow for easier engagement. 
    Based upon my analysis of the graph I began to examine new ways into making the graph more effective. I wanted to make the scope of the graph more effective, so I compared regional data which incorporated the use of California and Texas as opposed to the individual states. This would allow the graph  to work in tangent with the visualization which already exists. I also decided to look at making a grouped bar graph, which would allow me to see the gravity of yearly data in a cleaner and more effective perceptive way.  I also wanted to change the title and axis portions of the graph, to enhance usability and  expand graph completeness. In order to work on these updates to the graph, I completed a skecth of my  improvements. 
    
# Initial sketch 
![Assignment 3 ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123436415/217416801-13a28dc9-7a83-4524-81ba-047a0e880c15.JPG)

My intial skecth incorporated the ideas which I had based on my critique above. I created grouped color graphs to represent the different times within the study area. This  allowed for a better connection to be understood between the data and the axis. Doing such should have enhanced readability  of the graph. It would also have enhanced the usefullness by examing every individual region within the United States, as opposed to just two States.  I rewrote the title, to try and make the narrative clearer. I also played with light and dark color palates to see the types of colors which could best reflect the data. I played around with the location of the x axis in comparsion to the y, to see if there was a better way to associate the positive and negatives percentage changes.  I also tried to see what would happpen if I expanded the flow of data by adding additional data points  to  the graph. This test sketch interpreted  5 regions within the United States. Clearing out the line graph was also an attempt at to try  and clear the graphs  data clustering providing additional usefulness and transparency.

The idea of the sketch was to see what adding additional information would do, for the overall completeness of the graph. I needed to consider how to add additional information while balancing the usefullnes and intial perceptability of the graph. The sketch was intended to examine what additional information could do increase engagement and enhance the intial aesthetics with additional color palates and clean design  The main concern was what adding additional regions to the graph would do to the truthfullness of the data being represented.  Creating new averages per region could offset the efficiency of the data, which I considered  during the peer review. 


# Feedback from Peers
After completing the intial sketch I brought it to some of my peers to provide feedback, resulting in additional design improvements.  I had multiple  peers review my intiial design.  During which, they analyzed the impact of the graphs capability to tell a story and provided ideas for additional redesign 

The first peer, a student in their 20's indicated that the offset color of the graph takes away from its intent. When asked what the graph intially was, they indicated that they believed it to be comparing housing prices within the United States. They found the intial color design to be confusing, because too much color was taking away from overall  story of the graph.  A restructuring of regions was a good idea, but needs to be balanced with usefullness and readability. They indicated that the title and  the % change on the y axis, are disconnected from the representation of the bar graphs, and require the graph be made more static.  The sizeing of spacing of the grouped bars made it easier to have a direct comparsion; however additional work is needed to ensure the year the sizing and the y axis is better constructed to organize the story. 

The second peer, a student in their 30's indicated that they intially could not tell what the graph was trying to indicate. They said that the mass use of color and the misleading titles, lead to a misunderstanding of the  graphs intent.  They also said that the range of percentages on the y axis, was still disconnecting from the main concept.  
The peer stated that  additional data needs to be represented better through a removal of unncessary color and restrucutre of regional data.  They indicated that a bar graph, although good for grouping differet results, in its curret sketch did not best connect the idea of the percentage change of housing prices. They correctly deduced that the graphs audience is the general public as well as policy analysts. 

Based on the feedback provided from my peers, it was clear that my sketch needed to have several adjustments be made. The first being that there was too much color on the graph. I need to find a way to reduce color while also keeping enough data to add to the completness and usefullness of the graph. Further the right balace of color would help create a better aesthetic for the graph. Secondly both students recommended a better change in  titles and axis design could lead to enhanced clarity. They both also indicated that I needed to strike a balance between expanding detail but not adding too much as to decrease usefullness, and clarity. 


# Final Design

Based on the feedback from my peers, as well as the critique of the initial design, I decided to create a grouped bar graph which also had  a line indicating the comparison of United State average data. Doing such enabled me to change the narrative slightly, while keeping high levels of truth within the graph. The graph below represents my redesign. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12680327"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

My new design,incorporated more data while keeping to a comparison that was similar to the intial graph. I changed the title to show an analysis of the Western United States, which allowed mt to compare markets such as California and Texas within wider regions. I also incorporate a new title and y axis title, which better represent the comparison of data. It adds usefullness and completeness to the deisgn, by making the first glance of the graph interpretable as opposed to the first graph. I used  light colors, to represent the bars of two regions of the United States. This added additional data to the graph while balancing for a clean looking graph design that has minmal information. To add distinction to the United  States market, I used a line graph to represent the United States average housing prices. This allowed to keep the strength of the analysis of the first graph while expanding usefulness and completeness. The sleeker design also leads to a higher rate of engagment amongst the audience. The graph also incorporated  feedback by cleaning up the x and y axis designs. The bar graph now pushes the x axis time series below the neagtive numbers on the y axis. This cleans up the design, while making a deeper connection between the percentage changes in housing prices. The new chart alos had time entries for every two years, which cleaned the design while also conintinuing to embrace the data analysis of the graph.

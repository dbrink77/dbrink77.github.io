# Assignment 3 and 4
This assignment required selecting a graph in written work to interpret, critique, analyze, and redesign. The analysis below indicates each individual part of this process as it was completed. 

# Selection of Graph
For this weeks graph, I chose a graph found with an analysis of housing markets completed by the Urban Institute. The graph can be found below.

The graph was chosen based upon my interest in housing policy. Housing policy is one of my main areas of reseaarch focus, thus selecting a graph relating to a housing topic, allows me to create the best critique and redesigin possible. Further the context of the graph is based upon shifting housing markets throughout California and Texas. The fact the graph shows shiting changes within the data, meaans its impact is not static. This indicates to me that the data behind the graph is compelling and can offer additional stories about regional housing shifts. The non static information also provides additional opportunity to examine markets beyond California and Texas.  The flexibility to add additional means of regional analysis, provides ample opportunity for successful graph redesign, making the graph a compelling candidate for narrative creation. Finally, the topic of housing prices is one that is relevant for ongoing policy makers as affordable housing development becomes more expansive throughout the United States.  


# Anaylsis of Graph Effectiveness

Upon first glance, the graph is relatively intuitive to understand. The simplicity in the design allows a reader to understand the comparisons being made amongst the individual markets assessed. The non static nature of the lines, allows for an intuition to understand how housing prices increased and decreased along the studied perid of time. This allows for policy makers to make compelling insights around what events within the 2000's such as elections, recessions, wars etc.. could have had upon housing markets. The trend lines could provide insight into the types of policies whihc have been effective in creation naturally affordable housing prices. 
It is clear from the graph, that is usefullness is limited by its current scope. The graph could work in conjunction with another graph that provides additional context to regions within the United States. Further a lack of numbers on the graph also make the graph less useful in  terms of overall averages of housing prices. The data set itself did not have housing prices readily available, and without them, the graph misses out on additional clarification of what a drop and or increased percentage needs per individual percentage changes in housing prices. The non use of a title on the y axis to better explain they are percentages, also leads to a lack of transparency and usefullness. If a reader could not associate the y axis with percentages, the the axis and comparing point of the graph becomes unclear.
  The y axis also has a 0 split in the middle of it, which does not assist with the peceptinility and completeness of the graph. Having a number line in the middle of the graph without dropping the  x axis further down, confused readers with what negative numbers versus positive numbers indicate. This design error decreases the effect of the information, and can leave readers less engaged to the graphs impact. 
    The intersecting of lines,also decreases the readibility and usefullness of the graph.  As the graph gets further down the scale of time, it becomes more crowded. This leads a loss of engagement as a result of undecipherable results. A spreading out of points along the graph would make the storyclear and allow for easier engagement. 
    Based upon my analysis of the graph I began to examine new ways into making the graph more effective. I wanted to make the scope of the graph more effective, so I compared regional data which incorporated the use of California and Texas as opposed to the individual states. This would allow the graph  to work in tangent with the visualization which already exists. I also decided to look at making a grouped bar graph, which would allow me to see the gravity of yearly data in a cleaner and more effective perceptive way.  I also wanted to change the title and axis portions of the graph, to enhance usability and  expand graph completeness. In order to work on these updates to the graph, I completed a skecth of my  improvements.

My intial skecth incorporated the ideas which I had based on my critique above. I created grouped color graphs to represent the different times within the study area. This  allowed for a better connection to be understood between the data and the axis. Doing such should have enhanced readability  of the graph. It would also have enhanced the usefullness by examing every individual region within the United States, as opposed to just two States.  I rewrote the title, to try and make the narrative clearer. I also played with light and dark color palates to see the types of colors which could best reflect the data. I played around with the location of the x axis in comparsion to the y, to see if there was a better way to associate the positive and negatives percentage changes.  I also tried to see what would happpen if I expanded the flow of data by adding additional data points  to  the graph. This test sketch interpreted  5 regions within the United States. Clearing out the line graph was also an attempt at to try  and clear the graphs  data clustering providing additional usefulness and transparency.

The idea of the sketch was to see what adding additional information would do, for the overall completeness of the graph. I needed to consider how to add additional information while balancing the usefullnes and intial perceptability of the graph. The sketch was intended to examine what additional information could do increase engagement and enhance the intial aesthetics with additional color palates and clean design  The main concern was what adding additional regions to the graph would do to the truthfullness of the data being represented.  Creating new averages per region could offset the efficiency of the data, which I considered  during the peer review.

# Rising Rents in Pittsburgh: An analysis of  the housing market within Pittsburgh 
As rents accross the country continue to rise at steady rates, one has to wonder what the impact of increased rents will have on overall location affordability. Pittsburgh, and its history as a industrial legacy city, is not immune to rising living costs, and has seen rental prices grow throughout the last decade. 
With a recent article indicating Pittsburgh rents rising as much as 15.5 % from prior 2020 rental levels, an analysis as to how  rent within Pittsburgh compares to other Metropolitan areas throughout the country could indicate future projections of the disappearance of naturally occuring affordable housing within the city. 
Further assessing the impact of subsidies being used in the development of affordable housing within the city, will assist in the overall measurement of future regional affordability. 

# Motivation for analyzing Pittsburgh affordability
Housing should be considered a universal right, as it is required for survival and economic advancement within the ever changing world. As a result of historical redlining policies, vulnerable communities remain deeply impacted by the dissapearance of affordable housing. The usage of local inclusionary zoning practices, is not enough to ensure affordable housing remains affordable for all. The need and use of Federal subsidies is required to analzye and interpret future regional affordability, as it provides vehicles for producing permanent affordable housing within markets induced with change. 

The purpose of this project is to assess where Pittsburgh ranks with regards to contineud economic affordability. With only 30 percent of income dedicated to hosuing, can an individual making the median income within Pittsburgh only spend 30% of their income on housing, or has the changes in the market strain and rising rental prices, lead to the pricing out of communities? The secondary question is to assess how Pittsburghs rental market compares to other States and Metropolitan Areas within the United States. Is it still deemed to be more affordable to live then other places, or has the declining vacancy rates and availability of housing within Pittsburgh increased its overal market expense. 

Within this project , I am interested in using data visualizations to show the comparisons of how vacacny rates and rental prices have impacted overall affordability within  Pittsburgh. I will also argue the increased use of subsidy in housing developmet provides vulnerable communities wtih hope of a brighter future. The overall structure of this project will cover histroical comparisons of Pittsburgh markets to others in relation to rental affordability and accessibility. It will follow with assessing the conflict of how the impacts of Covid have left an affect on affordability of rental costs. Finally it will represent how the use of subsidiy and reccomendations relating to changes in local policies can lead to a sustainable future. 

# Pittsburgh- the more affordable metro area
This portion of the outline analyzes how Pittsburgh has historically stacked up against other  metropolitan areas throughout the United States. The sketches below indicate and represent that Pittsburgh has predominantly been one of the more affordable areas then other areas. Prior to Covid rental prices remained steady for most markets, and Pittsburghs saw some rise in rent costs, but nearly as big as it did after the Covid years  I want the graphs below to reflect how over the years, Pittsburgh has had a more affordable rate of living then other Metropolitan areas within the NorthEast. Further the graphs would reflect how Pittsburgh compares to overal rates  of regions of the United States. This narrative help sets up the rising problem, being that unstable renting prices and accessibility issues of housing , have turned Pittsburgh into a less affordable city.


Add in Sketches around market comparisons 





# Pittsburgh in Crises: Rising Rents and  Housing Scarcity
After analyzing pre- 2020 levels of housing affordability, this section elevats the problem that covid brought to Pittsburgh rental prices. A decline in availabe housing units, lead to more competitive higher rents, as more people were looking for less available housing throughout the city. The skecthes below represent this problem by showing overall rental vacancies witin Pittsburgh  versus the rest of Pennsylvania. The line graph will show the relationship between the two areas, while showing how rapid declining vacancy rates means less overal available market rentals.  The Bar Graph and line graph used in the prior section will used to only show the time frame of 2019-2022 to show the immediate impact of COVID on rental markets as opposed to historical trends. 




# Pittsburgh Affordability At an Impasse
After showing the  housing scarcity and rapid rate of rent increase from the prior section, this section builds upon the problem by showing a graph relating to the breakdown of  Pittsburgh median income versus the avergage yearly rate of rent needed to live within the city. The increase in rental prices over the time frame should  outweigh income growth, showing that Covid rapidly elevated an affordability crises wtihin the city. 




# Afforadable Housing Development to the Rescue?

After analyzing the impact of Covid, this section will provide a solution by showing active use of Federal housing subsidy and grant  programs, to offset pricing out off communities through the creation of affordable housing based projects. This section will also rely upon narrative built through ongoing city policy implementation of encourgaging affordability, through the use of narrative from the mayors transition plan, and recently news articles citing the creation of mixed development units in the Pittsburgh downtwon area in coverted office spaces.  The sketches are to represent the allocation of funding Pittsburgh is using from federal sources to build affordable housing. They further represent how many units of housing will be developed through investing federal funding into city planning. 



# Local Changes in Policy to support Private-Public Partnerships

This section will  concluded the story by arguing for changes in developer based rules to encourage the development of additional affordable units. It will emphasize the use  of density bonuses,  as well as additional funding sources available to private developers to enhance the construction of affordable units in mixed development by choice as opposed to force through inclusionary zoning practices. 


# Data Sources

The data sources I am using combine the use of federal databases, as well as use of census data and labor statistics. The data sources being used are as follows:

Census- The American Community Survey:
The American Community Survey provides a wide variety of information around median income, rental costs and rental vacancies. The tables provided allow me to analyze the incorporated data from a variety of different geographical locations. This allows me to make comparisons between  rental vacacny rates over a period of time, simultaneously comparing Pittsburgh to the rest of the Pennsylvania, as well as United States regions and individual states.  I plan on using it to create regional comparisons between vacancy rates, to show the correlation between low vacancy rates, and high costs of rent throghout periods of time before and after the high points of Covid in 2020.

BEA  Data:
 I will also be using it for average rental price data as well as for per capita income comparisons. The ACS retal data link is a downloaded and cleaned average rental set, showing the changes in rent from 2010-2021. The per capita income chart, is used to help reflect and correlate rental prices with local Pittsburgh income. The data will be used in a graph comparing higher prices of rent with the share of income used to pay for housing.

 Subsidy Data information:
 https://cpd.hud.gov/cpd-public/consolidated-plans
 The information found using the link above, indicates all of the plans and allocation of federal funds by Pittsburgh. The reports cover the cities expenditures and use  funds relating to CBDG, HOME,HOPWA and additional HUD based programs reflected within the federal subsidy graph. These reports will also give me the number of housing projects developed using the grants, as well as the number of people being served through the grants. This will provide me with additional information to help finalize my graphs, and show the impact that subsidies are having on affordable housing development. It also helps to further argue for a call to action, indicating that federal funds only go so far, and private- public partnerships are required for sustainability. 
 
 Low Income Housing Tax Credit information:
 The Low Income Housing Tax Credit program, is not a HUD based program, as such it requires a different link to download the data set. The uploaded file, represents all of the different projects that used  LIHTC to create affordable housing wtihin the city. The results will be filtered, to only show proects from 2017- 2022 as the rest of the subsidy data is being analyzed for the same time period. LITHC data will be used to show how many completed projects and how many affordable units were developed within the same time frame. It  will be used to further make the call to action point that additional means of funding and policy changes at the local level are required to ensure sustainable affordable housing for the future.  The link below leads to the main search engine for finding LIHTC data. It is not available in an excel format, so I am going to download the text file and transform it into an excel file, for easy use when making graphs.

 # Method and Medium
 I intend on creating the project and presentation purely using Shorthand. I do not intend on using any powerpoint presentation, but rather will use the visualizations and narrative written in shorthand, to tell my story.  The use of descriptive titles will allow me to break up my presentation with the aids of the final charts represennted in the previous sections.

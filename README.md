# Dennis Heinz  Telling Stories with Data Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  This is where you can find all of the cool ongoing projects I am working on.  I post my ongoing GIS maps and advanced visualizations into this portfolio, so  it fully represents the diversification of my skills. 

# About me
Hello! My name is Dennis Brink, I am a second year masters student studying in the Heinz school of information systems and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently studying public policy, where I specialize in housing policy research. I have analyzed housing from a variety of different sub categories such as affordable housing,  land recycing initiatives and blight mitigation intervention. My current research is assessing the impact vacant land has upon community health within disadvantaged communities. 
What I love most about studying at Carnegie Mellon, is that learn new tools in analyzing data to create innovative solutions  to some of the biggest social challenges. Data can be a powerful resource, and when it is used to advance the needs of the public, it can create long term sustainability. My favorite type of data analysis to conduct is spatial and visual analysis. I enjoy unpacking complex data, and  converting it into to strong narratives used to educate the public. My favorite tools I currently are GIS and Tableau. I am currently learning R and Python in my spare time to expand the tools within my tool kit. 
# What I hope to learn
Telling stories with Data is a great classs which will help strenghten my ability to use visualizations to tell impactful stories within the public policy space. Given that my current place of work has a lot of data at their disposal, this can be a class which  has immediate impact within my growth and work development. Through this class I hope to lean the following

1. How better use advanced visualizations to  better represent my research and work. In my research I am constanttly trying to find better ways of representing complex data set for public interpretation. I'm hoping this class will help me from a design thinking perspective, which will better help the foundation of my visualizations. 
2. Create an innovative space where I can keep my best work. As my work becomes more complex, I am often find myself wanting to create a space where anybody can see how my interests and skills are reflected through my projects. I am hoping this class provides me the foundations of building a portfolio that bet reflects my skill set and work. 
3. I want to also better understand how to critique data visualizations. When I am reviewing my own work, I can often fall victim to being biased around how I few any improvements it needs. Beyond obvious aspects, it can be difficult to find tune my own critiquing. I am hoping that through this course I can leave with a better and respectful approach to critiquing visualizations, making my work better, and allowing me to provide better feedback to my colleagues.

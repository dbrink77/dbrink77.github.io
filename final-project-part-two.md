# Vacancy and Population Decline in Pittsburgh
Text here!
Throughout Part I of the Final, I developed sketches and graphs based on the idea and concept of assesing whether incresaed federal subsidy impacts economic development within Pittsburgh. The idea was to analyze federal subsidy programs such as Low Income Housing Tax Credits and CBDG Funding and comapre them over time with housing markets within Pittsburgh and rental vacancy rates. My intial sketches were based on that general idea and concept. 
After running through the data, looking at prior assignment feedback I realized my scope was too narrow, and that I needed to readjust my focus and skecthes. While wireframing new sketches below, I began to plan a new approach to my final project, which involved a slight change in story. 
# Wireframing  of my new narrative

Based on previous feedback I changed my topic to focus more on the aspect of why Pittsburgh populations continues to decline despite  having a relattively competitive market. Using my concepts from before, I was able to develop out new graphs which lead me to expand my overall focus of my project. 
The first part of my story was to initally assess the impact of Pittsburgh's overal market. The created visualizations below  represented this key concept and idea for my first portion. 

# Vacancy Rates Sketch
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12803341"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

The Vacancy  rate identified a variety of housing vacancies over an extended period of time, in comparative markets.  A line graph was the best method to use for this, because it helped represent change over time. 

# Median Metropolitan Income Skecth
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12813209"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

The Median Metropolitan Income graph represents comparative incomes across a variety of metropolitan cities. Graying was used to direct emphasis on Pittsburgh and comparative markets. 

# Housing Market Prices
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12811969"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
 
Hosuing market prices were used to analyze the competitiveness of Pittsburgh's market in comparison to other markets. Graying was again used to draw empahsis to where it was needed. 

# Wireframing of second part of story
The next part of the story analzyed initally analyzed a closer lense at why Pittsburgh population is still declining even though it boasts a coompetitive marktet. In order to do this, I created a graph around population decline. I also moved the vacancy rates of Pittsburgh towards this portion of the wireframing. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12813049"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

The population graph was supposed to represent declines between 2010 and 2021. I broke up the data into different age groups, to help  make a point of comparison between the two highest population groups, that being over 55 and between 24 and 35. This coincides with Pittsburgh average age being around 30. 

# Wireframing third portion of story- Solution and Reccomendation

The final portion of my story was to reccomend a way forward using charts and figures to identify ways to young talent within the city. This would ensure Pittsburgh's market continues to grow while also becoming younger. The idea was to compare current available majors and skill sets with the types of growth in industry which makes Pittsburgh unique. 

# Highest Employed Industries Sketch
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12829395"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

This sketch indicates my initial attempt  at depicting the highest amount of industry represented within Pittsburgh currently. This helps put into perspective how retaining young talent makes sense, setting up a compelling argument with the additional graphs below. 

# Type of Industry and Companies
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12829318"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

The types of industries and companies represent the new industry developing within Pittsburgh. It is supposed to help build the narrative through fortifying the need to connect with young talent who have the skill set, provided by universities.

# Amount of majors by University
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12829423"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

This graph, helps to show the amount of degrees and majors young talent study while in Pittsburgh. This helps enables the concept and idea of how Pittsburgh has young talent it just needs to retain while they live here as opposed to having them utilize the education system and then leave. 

# Current Enrolled Students
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12812946"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Current enrolled students, allow for an understanding for the pool of talent currently available to retain. This is critical for  understanding how Pittsburgh is missing out on potential talent. 

# StoryBoard

I took the graphs indicated above, and brought them into the story board linked above. Using the combination of graphs within Flourish and using a storyboard model on shorthand, I was able to draft a story to bring to user feedback. 
The story is broken into three sections, each having a title to help with story transition.  Graphs were then incorporated into the individual sections, with additional written narraitve to help further branch and link the story together as they unfold.

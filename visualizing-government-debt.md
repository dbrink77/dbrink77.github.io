Above is a line graph representing  changes to country Debt-GDP ratios over an extended period of time. The curved line graphs, enable the reader to understand trends and patterns amongst the economic vitality of countries since 1995.  Red was chosen as the line graph, becuase the three colors which typically represent financial based reports and graphs are green, red and black.  Choosing red, reflects not only a connection with money, but the potential for losses and decreasing ratios which represent a stronger or weaker overall country economic  performance.
